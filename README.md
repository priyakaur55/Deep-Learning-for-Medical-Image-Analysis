Deep Learning for Medical Image Analysis: Diagnosis and Segmentation of Lung Cancer

Medical image analysis has become increasingly important in clinical diagnosis, treatment planning, and
disease monitoring. One of the most difficult tasks in this field is detecting and segmenting lung cancer in
CT scans. Early detection is crucial for successful treatment outcomes since lung cancer is the leading
cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Our project aims to design and develop a deep learning model
based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for classifying and segmenting lung cancer in CT scans.

The model will be trained and tested on a dataset of CT scans collected from various clinical settings

CNN Architecture Design:
Our CNN model will have several convolutional layers that are followed by pooling layers, to reduce the
size of the input images. We will use ReLU activation function to add non-linearity to the model. The
convolutional layers output will be flattened and passed through a fully connected layer to produce the
final output.

Default Settings:
We are thinking of including the following default settings in our model.
self.size
self.NoSlices
self.dataDirectory
self.labels
Visualize

Hyperparameter Tuning:
To optimize the performance of our CNN model, we will experiment with different hyperparameters, such
as the number of convolutional layers, filters, kernel size, pooling size, learning rate, batch size, and
number of epochs. We will use Grid Search and Random Search techniques to determine the optimal
hyperparameter values for our model.

Overfitting Prevention Techniques:
To prevent overfitting in our proposed CNN model, we will use several techniques such as dropout, early
stopping, and weight regularization.

Data Splitting and Performance Evaluation:
To ensure reliable results, we will divide our dataset into three subsets: a training set, a validation set, and
a test set. The training set will be utilized to train the model while the validation set will help us optimize
hyperparameters. Finally, we will evaluate our model on the test set to assess its performance. We will
employ various evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the
efficacy of our proposed model.

Data Augmentation:
To increase the sample size in the training set, we will employ data augmentation techniques such as
rotation, flipping, scaling, and translation. These techniques can effectively prevent overfitting and
enhance the model's ability to generalize to new and unseen data.
Significance:
The proposed CNN model will provide an automated and accurate way of detecting and segmenting lung
cancer in CT scans. This can potentially save lives by enabling early detection of lung cancer and facilitating
timely treatment planning. Additionally, our proposed model can be extended to other medical image
analysis tasks and can contribute to the development of deep learning-based diagnostic tools for various
clinical settings.
